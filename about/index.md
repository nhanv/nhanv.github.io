## Nhạ Nguyễn
Please call me Nathan or PhilipsNull. I live in Ha Noi.</br>
I have experience in working with Android SDK, Java (OOP, Jetty, ...), Construct2, C++ (cocos2dx, ...)...</br>
I have a passion for traveling and exploring. I hope I can go to everywhere in the world.</br>
One of my favourite is programming. It is very interesting.</br>
But it's not all. Besides, I have my family, my life, my friend...</br>
My goal establish this blog is created a place to store my knowledge, to share my experience,  to inspire both you and me to programming... and to talk anything.</br>
